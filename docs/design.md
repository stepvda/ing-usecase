# Design: how the comparator is built, and what it refuses to claim

Split out of `README.md`. The runbook is
[`pipeline.md`](pipeline.md); the decision log is [`decisions.md`](decisions.md).
The short version of this file is the project's central bet: **every number on
screen comes from one definition, and anything judgement-based says so.**

## The feature dictionary is the contract

`config/feature_dictionary.yaml` is the single source of truth. The dataset
schema, the validator and `docs/feature_dictionary.md` are all derived from it,
so they cannot drift apart. Edit the YAML; never edit the generated markdown.

Each feature declares:

- **extraction** — `automatic` (code, reproducible), `rubric` (human, against a
  written scale), `model_assisted` (LLM/vision, prompt recorded), or `derived`.
  This is what determines how far a value can be trusted.
- **comparability** — `cross_language`, `within_language` (word counts and
  readability cannot cross NL/FR/EN), or `within_capture_window` (rates move).
- **tier** — `core` is the MVP minimum; `extended` is added only after the gate
  passes. 104 features today.

**Freeze rule:** after the Day 2 freeze, columns may be *added* but never renamed
or removed without all three of us agreeing. The analysis code depends on them.
New *values* inside an existing enumeration count as an addition — that is how
the bank list grew to fourteen on 21/09 (see `D01_scope_and_compliance_note.md`).

Two checks enforce it, deliberately:

- `tests/test_schema.py::test_dictionary_matches_frozen_snapshot` — byte equality
  against `feature_dictionary.frozen.yaml`. Catches an *accidental* edit.
- `scripts/check_schema_freeze.py` — the rule itself. Additions pass; renames,
  removals, type changes, narrowed ranges or categories, tier demotions and
  tightened nullability fail, naming the feature.

Byte equality alone is not the rule: it fails on an addition (which the rule
permits) and it *passes* on a rename, because updating both files makes the bytes
match again. A rename is the change that actually breaks analysis code.

## One model labels every bank

The pinned model is **`deepseek-flash`** ([D6](decisions.md); it replaced
`deepseek-chat` when DeepSeek retired that alias). Put the key in `.env`
(gitignored); `scripts/_bootstrap.py` loads it, so no `export` is needed. A real
environment variable still wins over the file. Never put a key in `.env.example`
— that file is tracked and public.

About a quarter of the dictionary is model-assisted, and the provider chain falls
back when one is rate-limited — so a run could label ING with one model and
Revolut with another. Every row records `extraction_model`, and `validate()` warns
when a dataset mixes models and names which banks got which. A difference between
banks has to be a difference between banks, not between two judges (NFR-02).

The same check applies to the rubric: nothing pre-fills the judged sheet. A
pre-filled sheet gets rubber-stamped, and the scores would then record how
persuasive the suggestion was rather than what the rater saw. The
model's own rubric sheet is gone with the inter-rater layer — one named person
scores the pages, and no reliability figure is claimed.

## Compare like for like, not everything at once

`--product-family current_account_pack` (or `auto`) restricts the comparison to
one product family. Pooling families confounds every cross-bank difference with
the product — a mortgage page and a current-account page differ because the
*products* differ (DR-04). The runner prints which families are comparable, and
refuses to continue if one side of the traditional/challenger split is empty.

Language works the same way: the dataset is collected in Belgian French for
comparability, and the eight `within_language` features are excluded from every
cross-bank comparison when a page in another language sneaks in.

## What the validator refuses

`comparator.schema.validate` is deliberately strict — a silent schema drift costs
more than a loud failure. It fails on missing required columns, columns absent
from the dictionary, values outside a declared range or category, duplicate
`page_id`, nulls in a non-nullable feature, and — as a hard compliance gate —
**any row whose `robots_allowed` is false** (LC-01).

It warns, rather than fails, on synthetic or LLM-generated rows and on a bank
missing a core feature entirely (DR-07).

## No synthetic data in the repo

`src/comparator/fixtures.py` builds a synthetic dataset **in memory** for the test
suite. Nothing synthetic is committed and nothing synthetic reaches `outputs/`.

That is deliberate. The fixture's per-bank archetypes were written *from* the
claims in the ING kickoff deck, so an analysis run against it always confirms
them — `check_deck_claims` comes back "supported" every time, by construction. A
committed synthetic CSV sitting next to `run_analysis.py` is an invitation to run
it and read the result as a finding.

`scripts/make_fixture.py` still writes one to `data/fixtures/` if you want it for
local development. The ignore rule for that path was removed on 21/09 with the
other data rules, so nothing stops a fixture from being committed any more — do
not commit it. Everything in `outputs/` comes from
`data/processed/campaigns.csv` — real captures.

## What analysis answers

| Question | Function | PRD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where does ING stand vs competitors? | `ing_vs_peers` | BO-01, FR-09 |
| Traditional or challenger? | `positioning_axis` | BO-02 |
| Which banks communicate alike? | `similarity_matrix`, `cluster_banks` | BO-03 |
| What recurring patterns cross the whole market? | `recurring_patterns` | BO-04 |
| What separates the two groups? | `category_comparison` | FR-08 |
| Which gaps are worth arguing from, with evidence? | `insight_candidates` | BO-06, FR-10 |
| Do the deck's observations hold? | `check_deck_claims` | FR-14 |

BO-05 (reusable feature framework) isn't a function — it's demonstrated by adding
a bank via config, not code (FR-16). BO-07 (compliant, reproducible method) lives
in `collection/compliance.py` and `schema.py`.

Sample sizes are small by design (PRD risk R-03). Nothing here computes a p-value
or claims significance — Cohen's d is reported as a description of separation, not
as a test. With 14 banks, most of which carry a single page per family, a group
mean is an anecdote (FR-13/F-14 scale).

## The three signals that are not page measurements

Two optional signals sit beside the page analysis, and both are fenced off from
the performance claim:

- **Search interest** (`trends.py`, the Trends tab) is context, never an outcome.
  It measures what people searched for, not what a campaign achieved, and it is
  not regressed onto any page feature — the module refuses to emit a per-page
  number for exactly that reason. On the Recommendations tab it selects which
  competitor brands are worth studying; `benchmarks.py` then reports what those
  brands' pages measurably do, from the same features as the analysis. The two
  halves are joined on the bank name and nothing else, and the section says so:
  it shows what those pages do, never that this is why they are searched for.
- **News themes** (`reputation.py`, the Reputation tab) count what each bank is in
  the news *about* — never sentiment. Sentiment scoring was explicitly out of
  scope; themes turn the brief's own "réputation, innovations, crises" framing
  into a closed, countable list.

Neither makes this a performance study. **No performance data exists in this
project**: nothing links a design choice to a click, a conversion or a sale. Every
recommendation is a hypothesis ING could test, never a cause (PRD 5.2).

## The web surface, and what it is not

The React UI in `web/` is the surface the business reader uses. It has ten tabs
and they fall into two groups.

**Findings.** Analysis carries the scope banner, the focus verdict, the peer
gaps, the group separation, the similarity matrix, the bank cards, the personas,
the AI Score, cross-sell, the regional search interest, the deck-claim verdicts
and the generated limitations. Trends, Reputation and Recommendations are the
three signal tabs described above.

**Operator views.** Home, Bank profiles, Data, Rubric and Collection are the
read-only views that used to live in `streamlit_app.py`. They read
`operations.json`, which `export_web_report.py` writes from the same library
calls as `report.json`, so the scope banner and the collection status cannot
disagree. Research is not one of them: it is served live by `serve_web.py`'s
`/api/research/search`, the one outbound call the UI makes, so it needs the
backend rather than the snapshot. Two boundaries are deliberate and enforced by
the shape of the code:

- **No pipeline control and no dataset editing.** There is no endpoint that
  writes a dataset row, a rubric cell or the dictionary. The dictionary is the
  frozen contract (P-04); a form that edited it would undo the freeze rule, and
  a form that edited an extracted feature would destroy the audit trail. The one
  writable thing in the whole system remains a rubric sheet, and only through
  `rubric_sheet.py` by the rater who owns it.
- **No live scoring screen.** The Rubric tab shows the finished sheet, already
  merged. It is a read-only view after the fact: scoring happens against the
  written scales with the capture open, not in a screen that could show one
  person what anyone else wrote.

The UI does no arithmetic. Every number on screen is computed in Python and
handed over already qualified: the exporter ships the values and the labels that
say how far each may be trusted, and the browser only formats them. That is why
`src/types.ts` and `scripts/export_web_report.py` have to change together.
