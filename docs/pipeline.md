# The pipeline: collect → score → analyse → export

Split out of `README.md` because the README had grown into a
runbook plus a design document plus a UI guide. This file is the runbook: what
to type, in what order, and what lands where. The *why* lives in
[`design.md`](design.md), the UI in [`../web/README.md`](../web/README.md), and
the decision log in [`decisions.md`](decisions.md).

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in DEEPSEEK_API_KEY - .env is gitignored

# wiring only, no real data
python3 scripts/make_fixture.py                # synthetic dataset, in memory/only
python3 scripts/run_analysis.py                # the full chain: profiles, positioning, charts
python3 scripts/run_generation.py --dry-run    # step 5 without calling a model
python3 scripts/check_schema_freeze.py         # enforce the Day 2 freeze rule
```

## Real data, in order

```bash
# 1. collect + extract + validate (compliance -> scrape -> extract -> quality gate)
python3 scripts/run_collection.py --config scripts/collection_targets.yaml --method headless

# 2. if a model-assisted extraction timed out mid-collection, refill those fields
#    from the HTML already on disk (no re-fetch, but it is a fresh LLM call)
python3 scripts/reextract_model_fields.py --dataset data/processed/campaigns.csv

# 3. rubric: one judged sheet out, scored by hand, merged back
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py emit                        # the blank sheet + the guide
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py merge --sheet data/rubric/siegried_scores.csv

# 4. analyse, document, export for the web UI
python3 scripts/run_analysis.py --dataset data/processed/campaigns_scored.csv \
        --product-family auto --no-strict
python3 scripts/build_feature_docs.py      # regenerate docs/feature_dictionary.md
python3 scripts/export_web_report.py       # web/public/report.json + trends.json + operations.json
python3 scripts/serve_web.py               # optional: recommendations, site, research, downloads, captures
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

`export_web_report.py` writes two snapshots in one run, from the same library
calls: `report.json` is the business surface the Analysis tab reads, and
`operations.json` is the operator surface (feature dictionary, dataset table,
collection status, the judged sheet and the scales). The React UI needs
`operations.json` for its Home, Bank profiles, Data, Rubric and Collection tabs;
without it those tabs say so and the Analysis tab is unaffected. The Research tab
is not on that list - it queries Semantic Scholar live through `serve_web.py`, so
it needs the backend running rather than the snapshot.

`serve_web.py` is optional and read-only apart from the two model calls. It adds
four things a static bundle cannot hold: the recommendations and site generation
(`/api/recommendations*`, `/api/site/*`), Semantic Scholar search
(`/api/research/search`), the deliverables in `outputs/` (`/api/downloads`), and
the page captures (`/api/capture/{bank}`). It re-derives no number.

Outputs land in `outputs/`: four charts, `charts.md` explaining what each one
measures and what it cannot support, the profile cards as markdown and JSON, a
CSV per analysis step, `limitations.md`, `reputation.json` and (optionally)
`geo_trends.json`.

`charts.md` is generated, not written by hand. The "what this run shows"
paragraphs are built from the same objects the charts are drawn from, so the
prose cannot drift away from the picture.

## Where data lives

| Path | Tracked? | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/raw/<bank>/` | yes (since 21/09, see Housekeeping) | HTML snapshots + screenshots, one pair per page |
| `data/processed/campaigns.csv` | yes (since 21/09) | the collected dataset (auto features + model-assisted) |
| `data/processed/campaigns_scored.csv` | yes (since 21/09) | the same rows with rubric scores merged in — what analysis reads |
| `data/rubric/*_scores.csv` | yes | the human and model scoring sheets |
| `outputs/` | yes (team decision, see Housekeeping) | charts, tables, profiles, limitations, reputation |
| `web/public/report.json` | yes | the one JSON snapshot the business UI reads |
| `web/public/operations.json` | yes | the operator snapshot: dictionary, dataset, collection, rubric — read by the Home, Bank profiles, Data, Rubric and Collection tabs |
| `web/public/trends.json` | yes | the Trends tab's series (written when the export is present) |

`scripts/reextract_model_fields.py` is not a no-op: it refreshes **every**
model-assisted field on every row it touches, and the model is not deterministic,
so re-running it changes personas/cross-sell/imagery values. Only run it to fix a
specific gap (a timed-out extraction), and prefer note-taking over repeated runs.

The deterministic alternatives re-read `snapshot_html_path` and touch only the
columns whose detector changed — no LLM call, no re-fetch, so nothing else on the
row is re-rolled:

- `scripts/fix_rate_fields.py` — `rate_shown`, `rate_value_pct`, re-derived with
  the keyword-proximity rule in `_rate()`.
- `scripts/fix_cta_count.py` — `cta_count`, `cta_above_fold`: distinct
  (label, href) pairs, chrome excluded. `cta_count` is currently withdrawn from
  the comparison (`analysis.CAPTURE_INVALID_FEATURES`); the script stays because
  the stored column should still be the best value the rule can produce.

**MANDATORY re-merge after ANY change to campaigns.csv.**  
`scripts/rubric_sheet.py merge` **must be re-run** after any modification to
`data/processed/campaigns.csv` (rate fix, CTA fix, new captures, re-extraction,
etc.) — even if rubric scores haven't changed. The merge matches on `page_id`
(corrected — `merge_scores()` joins on `page_id`, not URL, see
`rubric.py:154`) and produces `campaigns_scored.csv` which `export_web_report.py`
and `run_analysis.py --dataset campaigns_scored.csv` read. Skipping this step
leaves the web report and analysis on stale data (silent drift). See
`decisions.md:277-300`. `tests/test_dataset_sync.py` now checks this
automatically (audit item #6).

**`page_id` itself can drift, not just the merge.** `page_id` is
built from `{bank}_{product_family}_{language}_{page_index:02d}` at collection
time (`run_collection.py:69`) — a re-collection that adds/removes a page in a
bank/family/language group renumbers every page after it. A rater's scoring
sheet built before that re-collection then carries scores under `page_id`s
that no longer exist in `campaigns.csv`, and `merge_scores()` drops them
silently (same failure mode, one step earlier in the pipeline). Found live
22/09: 6 rows in the judged sheet (there is only ever the one, Siegried's)
reference `page_id`s absent from the current 51-row `campaigns.csv`. Each was
checked individually rather than auto-remapped: one was a duplicate URL, two
were professional-account pages that do not belong in a retail comparison,
one was a filename typo, and two were pages never captured. None needed a
re-score or a recovery. Not yet covered by an automated test.

## Three things a range check cannot catch

**A capture can be honestly measured and still be the wrong page.** The first
live collection returned ING as an unrendered JavaScript shell (16 words — the
`<title>`, twice) and BNP Paribas Fortis as a maintenance notice. Every numeric
feature on those rows was in range. `collection/quality.py` judges whether a
capture looks like a campaign page at all, and the verdict travels with the row
in `capture_quality`. Analysis excludes `unusable` rows and says which.

**A capture can also be the right page with something else on top of it.**
Three of the 18 compared pages — Argenta, BNP Paribas Fortis and Crelan — were
captured with a cookie-consent modal open across the page. Their
screenshot-derived features (`background_luminance`, `hero_image_area_ratio`,
`accent_colour_count`, `brand_colour_share`, `above_fold_element_count`)
describe the modal, not the page underneath it; every value is still in range,
so nothing in `schema.validate` catches it. Text-derived and judged features
are unaffected. Not corrected here — named so it is not discovered by someone
else.

**13 features (10 core, 3 extended) are scored by a person**, so a collected dataset can never
pass strict validation on its own. `scripts/rubric_sheet.py` emits a sheet with
the screenshot path and merges the completed one back in. One judged sheet, one
named rater: no second opinion and no reliability figure, which is the scope
this proof of concept chose and which `outputs/limitations.md` states in those
words. The merge prints what it joined — rows that matched no page, and pages
left unscored — because a silent drop there is how a rater's work goes missing.

**One judged sheet, by one named person.** An earlier plan split the 14 banks
across rater pairs so every page carried two independent judgements, which is
what NFR-05 asks for. That is not what this project ships: the analysis runs on
a single sheet, so there is no second rater, no agreement figure and no
chance-corrected kappa, and `rubric_sheet.py` no longer has the subcommands that
produced them.

Single-judge bias is therefore un-measured here. It is named as such in
`outputs/limitations.md` and listed as the first thing a production build should
add, rather than left for a reader to notice.

## Two escape hatches for hosts that will not serve us

Both live in the targets file, per target, and neither changes what the pipeline
asks for — one request, robots.txt checked first, no IP or identity rotation:

- **`method: headful`** launches a real, visible Chrome instead of headless.
  BNP Paribas Fortis returns HTTP 503 to *every* headless client (bundled
  Chromium, real Chrome, bot or browser User-Agent) on every path including the
  homepage, and serves the same URL normally to a headful browser.
- **`wait_until: domcontentloaded` + `timeout_ms`** for pages that never go
  idle. Keytrade Bank keeps loading consent and analytics, so the default
  `networkidle` wait times out even though the page is readable long before.

## When a site will not serve the pipeline

corrected — this section described BNP Paribas Fortis and Revolut
as permanently unreachable. Both are resolved: BNP via `method: headful` (see
"Two escape hatches" above and `decisions.md`'s "BNP Paribas
Fortis captured" entry), Revolut via the current `collection_targets.yaml`
URL, which robots.txt allows (a straight headless fetch, no method override
needed). **There is no manual-capture-only bank left** — every one of the 51
current rows has `collection_method` in `{static_fetch, headless_render,
headful_render}`, never `manual_capture`.

The path below stays documented as a general escape hatch for a future site
that genuinely cannot be reached any other way, not because any bank needs it
today:

`scripts/import_captures.py` imports pages a person saved from a normal browser:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_captures.py --dir <folder> --merge-with data/processed/campaigns.csv
```

A human opening a public page and saving it is ordinary use of a public website,
not automation getting past a control. The importer still **re-checks robots.txt**
for every recovered URL rather than trusting that someone checked earlier, and it
recovers the URL from the browser's own "saved from url" comment so there is no
hand-written manifest to drift.

A manual capture carries `collection_method = manual_capture`, **no
`http_status`** (we made no request — writing 200 would claim a response nobody
received) and **no `page_height_px`** (a browser save is a *viewport* screenshot,
not a full-page one, so the height genuinely cannot be measured). A live capture
that worked is always preferred over a manual one for the same page.

Chrome writes shadow DOM out as `<template shadowrootmode>`, which BeautifulSoup
does not walk into — one saved ING page parsed as 14 words while carrying 4,858
inside templates. `extract()` flattens those, so a manual capture and a live
capture are measured the same way.

## Limitations are generated, not remembered

`outputs/limitations.md` (D-09) is written from the dataset on every run. If two
captures failed it names them and why; if the focus bank is missing it says which
questions that makes unanswerable; if the rubric is unscored it says so. A
limitation nobody can quietly drop on Day 9 is worth more than a well-written
paragraph.

## Search interest and reputation, when their inputs are missing

Both optional signals degrade instead of failing:

- **Trends** (`web/public/trends.json`) needs the `search_interest/export/`.
  Absent, the exporter writes no `trends.json` and the tab shows an empty state.
- **Reputation** (`outputs/reputation.json`, and the `reputation` block in
  `report.json`) needs `NEWSAPI_KEY` and/or `NEWSAPI_AI_KEY`. With neither set,
  `available: false` and the tab says so.

`available: true` on the reputation block means *a key is configured*, not that
articles were returned — a working key with a thin 90-day window yields an empty
bank snapshot rather than a false "not configured".

## Housekeeping

**Since 21/09 the data is tracked.** The `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`,
`data/fixtures/` and `outputs/` rules were removed from `.gitignore`, so the
captures, the datasets and the regenerated charts are all committed. A fresh
clone can therefore run the analysis without collecting first.

The trade-off is explicit: every collection or analysis run now produces a large
diff, including binary screenshots and charts, and `data/raw/` carries the banks'
own page captures and brand assets. Runtime artefacts stay ignored — `.env`,
`benchmark.db` and its backups, `*.log`, `web/dist/`, caches. If the diffs stop
being reviewable, restoring the four rules is one commit.
