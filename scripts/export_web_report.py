"""Export one JSON the business web UI renders.

    python3 scripts/export_web_report.py --dataset data/processed/campaigns_scored.csv \
        --product-family auto

The UI reads a single snapshot file and needs no server, which is
deliberate: a browser talking to a laptop is the wrong thing to depend on five
minutes before a stakeholder presentation, and a snapshot is the honest shape
for a finding anyway - it is true for one dataset at one capture date.

Reads the LIBRARY, not the output files. Re-parsing our own CSVs and markdown
would be a second, lossier definition of every number on the screen.

Everything the deck must not drop travels with the data: the scope, the capture
window, the sample sizes, the excluded banks and the limitations. The UI cannot
render a number without being handed what qualifies it.
