## Status

<!-- sieg 17/09: refreshed after a full repo audit - the table below was still
describing Day 3 while collection had moved well past it. See docs/D01 and
docs/day6_gate_discussion_notes.md for the per-bank detail this summarizes. -->
Day 4 of 10 (sieg 17/09). The analysis chain now runs end to end on real
captures for 7 banks (argenta, bunq, crelan, ing, kbc, n26, revolut). Belfius
and BNP Paribas Fortis have real captures and were scored by the model rater
(`docs/day5_scoring_disagreement.md` lists 8 pages), but are absent from the
current `outputs/bank_profiles.json` for a reason not yet documented — under
investigation, ask Stephane before assuming either is dropped for good. The
Day 5 human rubric session (2 independent raters, 13 features) has not
happened yet — only the model column is filled in
(`data/rubric/{dan,siegried,stephane}_scores.csv`); this is the current
blocker per `outputs/limitations.md`. Headless-render geometry fields
(`page_height_px` and three others) still wait on a working Chromium in the
collection environment.

| Deliverable | State |
| --- | --- |
| Feature dictionary v0.1 (D-03) | frozen (Day 2), additions since allowed by the freeze rule — 101 features, `feature_dictionary.frozen.yaml` in sync |
| Dataset schema + validator (D-04) | built and tested |
| Analysis skeleton (D-05) | runs end to end on real captures |
| Bank profile cards | generated, 7 banks (real data); Belfius/BNP captured but not in the current profile set, see note above |
| Real captures (D-02) | 9/9 banks have raw captures; BNP still needs the manual-capture path confirmed working, see D-01 |
| Rubric scoring (Day 5) | model column only — human 2-rater session not yet run |

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in DEEPSEEK_API_KEY - .env is gitignored

python3 scripts/make_fixture.py           # synthetic dataset, for wiring only
python3 scripts/run_analysis.py           # the full chain: profiles, positioning, charts
python3 scripts/run_generation.py         # step 5: generate 2 variants and score them
python3 scripts/run_generation.py --dry-run   # ...without calling a model
python3 scripts/check_schema_freeze.py    # enforce the Day 2 freeze rule

# real data
python3 scripts/run_collection.py --config scripts/collection_targets.yaml --method headless
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py emit      # scoring sheets for the 13 human-scored features
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py agreement --sheets data/rubric/*_scores.csv
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py model     # model scores as a third rater
python3 scripts/rubric_sheet.py merge --sheets data/rubric/*_scores.csv
python3 scripts/run_analysis.py --dataset data/processed/campaigns_scored.csv \
        --product-family auto --no-strict
python3 scripts/build_feature_docs.py     # regenerate docs/feature_dictionary.md
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q               # 259 tests
```

Outputs land in `outputs/`: four charts, `charts.md` explaining what each one
measures and what it cannot support, the profile cards as markdown and JSON, and
a CSV per analysis step.

`charts.md` is generated, not written by hand — `outputs/` is wiped on every run,
and the "what this run shows" paragraphs are built from the same objects the
charts are drawn from, so the prose cannot drift away from the picture.

## The feature dictionary is the contract

`config/feature_dictionary.yaml` is the single source of truth. The dataset schema,
the validator and `docs/feature_dictionary.md` are all derived from it, so they
cannot drift apart. Edit the YAML; never edit the generated markdown.

Each feature declares:

- **extraction** — `automatic` (code, reproducible), `rubric` (human, against a
  written scale), `model_assisted` (LLM/vision, prompt recorded), or `derived`.
  This is what determines how far a value can be trusted.
- **comparability** — `cross_language`, `within_language` (word counts and
  readability cannot cross NL/FR/EN), or `within_capture_window` (rates move).
- **tier** — `core` is the Day 6 MVP minimum (66 features); `extended` is added
  only after the gate passes (35 features).

**Freeze rule:** after the Day 2 freeze, columns may be *added* but never renamed
or removed without all three of us agreeing. The analysis code depends on them.

Two checks enforce it, deliberately:

- `tests/test_schema.py::test_dictionary_matches_frozen_snapshot` — byte equality
  against `feature_dictionary.frozen.yaml`. Catches an *accidental* edit.
- `scripts/check_schema_freeze.py` — the rule itself. Additions pass; renames,
  removals, type changes, narrowed ranges or categories, tier demotions and
  tightened nullability fail, naming the feature.

Byte equality alone is not the rule: it fails on an addition (which the rule
permits) and it *passes* on a rename, because updating both files makes the bytes
match again. A rename is the change that actually breaks analysis code.

## One model labels every bank

DeepSeek `deepseek-chat` is the pinned model ([D6](docs/decisions.md)). Put the
key in `.env` (gitignored); `scripts/_bootstrap.py` loads it, so no `export` is
needed. A real environment variable still wins over the file. Never put a key in
`.env.example` — that file is tracked and public. About a
quarter of the dictionary is model-assisted, and the provider chain falls back
when one is rate-limited — so a run could label ING with one model and Revolut
with another. Every row now records `extraction_model`, and `validate()` warns
when a dataset mixes models and names which banks got which. A difference between
banks has to be a difference between banks, not between two judges (NFR-02).

## Two things a range check cannot catch

**A capture can be honestly measured and still be the wrong page.** The first live
collection returned ING as an unrendered JavaScript shell (16 words — the `<title>`,
twice) and BNP Paribas Fortis as a maintenance notice. Every numeric feature on
those rows was in range. `collection/quality.py` judges whether a capture looks
like a campaign page at all, and the verdict travels with the row in
`capture_quality`. Analysis excludes `unusable` rows and says which.

**13 core features are scored by a person**, so a collected dataset can never pass
strict validation on its own. `scripts/rubric_sheet.py` emits one sheet per rater
with the screenshot path, merges completed sheets back, and reports inter-rater
agreement — which is what NFR-05 actually asks for.

## Limitations are generated, not remembered

`outputs/limitations.md` (D-09) is written from the dataset on every run. If two
captures failed it names them and why; if the focus bank is missing it says which
questions that makes unanswerable; if the rubric is unscored it says so. A
limitation nobody can quietly drop on Day 9 is worth more than a well-written
paragraph.

## When a site will not serve the pipeline

Some pages cannot be fetched by us at all — BNP's edge declines automated
traffic outright (diagnosed in `scripts/run_collection.py`, and not worked
around: getting past it would need IP rotation, which LC-04 forbids).

`scripts/import_captures.py` imports pages a person saved from a normal browser:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_captures.py --dir <folder> --merge-with data/processed/campaigns.csv
```

A human opening a public page and saving it is ordinary use of a public website,
not automation getting past a control. The importer still **re-checks robots.txt**
for every recovered URL rather than trusting that someone checked earlier, and it
recovers the URL from the browser's own "saved from url" comment so there is no
hand-written manifest to drift.

A manual capture carries `collection_method = manual_capture`, **no
`http_status`** (we made no request — writing 200 would claim a response nobody
received) and **no `page_height_px`** (a browser save is a *viewport* screenshot,
not a full-page one, so the height genuinely cannot be measured). A live capture
that worked is always preferred over a manual one for the same page.

Chrome writes shadow DOM out as `<template shadowrootmode>`, which BeautifulSoup
does not walk into — Siegried's saved ING pages parsed as 14 words while carrying
4,858 inside templates. `extract()` flattens those, so a manual capture and a live
capture are measured the same way.

## Compare like for like, not everything at once

`--product-family current_account_pack` (or `auto`) restricts the comparison to
one product family. Pooling families confounds every cross-bank difference with
the product — a mortgage page and a current-account page differ because the
*products* differ (DR-04). Every run carried that as a limitation; it did not
have to be one. The runner prints which families are comparable, and refuses to
continue if one side of the traditional/challenger split is empty.

## The model scores as a third rater, never as a pre-fill

`scripts/rubric_sheet.py model` scores the 9 text-inferable rubric features with
the pinned model into its **own** sheet. It never touches the human sheets —
a pre-filled sheet gets rubber-stamped, and the NFR-05 agreement figure would
then measure how persuasive the model's guess was rather than how well two
people agree. As a separate rater, model-vs-human agreement is measurable with
the same machinery, which is what FR-18 asks for.

The 4 vision-only features (`accent_locations`, `text_image_layout`,
`layout_archetype`, `mobile_first_design_signal`) stay blank and stay human: the
pinned model has no vision and the extractor only sends text, so scoring them
would be guessing from the wrong evidence.

## Integration with the rest of the team

**Rubric scoring is one workflow, not two.** `scripts/rubric_sheet.py report`
renders Siegried's `docs/day5_scoring_disagreement_template.md` **from** the
completed CSV sheets, so the agreement figure that goes in the deck is computed
rather than retyped. The "why" and "rubric fix" columns stay empty on purpose —
those are the judgements the session exists to produce.

**Search interest is context, never an outcome.** `src/comparator/trends.py`
joins Dan's `kbc-ing-benchmark` Google Trends exports to the campaign dataset on
bank + product family (`--trends-dir`), and degrades to nothing when the exports
are absent. It covers ING, KBC and CBC only, it measures what people searched
for rather than what a campaign achieved, and the pages captured are today's
pages — so it does **not** make this a performance study. The module refuses to
emit a per-page number for exactly that reason: a per-page column would end up
regressed against page features and called performance.

The Recommendations tab keeps that line. By default it writes advice from the
measured pages alone; ticking **Include Google Trends** adds a second, clearly
marked set of recommendations (`basis="trends"`) drawn from the same payload,
scoped to the product family the run measured and the last two years. Those
recommendations are about timing and focus — when to make a change, which page to
prioritise — and the prompt forbids them from citing a page feature as evidence.
The trends digest never carries a per-page number either.

**One `.env` mechanism.** `scripts/_bootstrap.py` now uses `python-dotenv`
(Siegried's dependency) instead of the hand-rolled parser it started with.

## Step 5 — campaign generation (stretch)

`scripts/run_generation.py` derives a numeric target from the data (ING's own
levels for the on-brand variant; the challenger group's medians for the
challenger-style one), asks the model for a campaign, renders it to HTML, and
scores it **with the same extractor that reads real bank pages**. The loop only
means something because there is exactly one measuring stick in this repo.

Targets never include a feature the guardrails forbid hitting — you cannot ask a
generator to match a bank's density of figures while forbidding it to invent
figures. Hitting the target means the generator followed instructions; it says
nothing about whether the campaign would perform better (plan risk P-08).

## What the validator refuses

`comparator.schema.validate` is deliberately strict — a silent schema drift on
Day 6 costs more than a loud failure on Day 2. It fails on missing required
columns, columns absent from the dictionary, values outside a declared range or
category, duplicate `page_id`, nulls in a non-nullable feature, and — as a hard
compliance gate — **any row whose `robots_allowed` is false** (LC-01).

It warns, rather than fails, on synthetic or LLM-generated rows and on a bank
missing a core feature entirely (DR-07).

## No synthetic data in the repo

`src/comparator/fixtures.py` builds a synthetic dataset **in memory** for the test
suite. Nothing synthetic is committed and nothing synthetic reaches `outputs/`.

That is deliberate. The fixture's per-bank archetypes were written *from* the
claims in the ING kickoff deck, so an analysis run against it always confirms
them — `check_deck_claims` comes back "supported" every time, by construction. A
committed synthetic CSV sitting next to `run_analysis.py` is an invitation to run
it and read the result as a finding.

`scripts/make_fixture.py` still writes one to `data/fixtures/` if you want it for
local development. That path is gitignored.

Everything in `outputs/` comes from `data/processed/campaigns.csv` — real captures.

## What analysis answers

| Question | Function | PRD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where does ING stand vs competitors? | `ing_vs_peers` | BO-01, FR-09 |
| Traditional or challenger? | `positioning_axis` | BO-02 |
| Which banks communicate alike? | `similarity_matrix`, `cluster_banks` | BO-03 |
| What recurring patterns cross the whole market? | `recurring_patterns` | BO-04 |
| What separates the two groups? | `category_comparison` | FR-08 |
| Which gaps are worth arguing from, with evidence? | `insight_candidates` | BO-06, FR-10 |
| Do the deck's observations hold? | `check_deck_claims` | FR-14 |

BO-05 (reusable feature framework) isn't a function - it's demonstrated by
adding a bank via config, not code (FR-16). BO-07 (compliant, reproducible
method) lives in `collection/compliance.py` and `schema.py`, not here.

Sample sizes are small by design (PRD risk R-03). Nothing here computes a p-value
or claims significance — Cohen's d is reported as a description of separation, not
as a test.

## Next

1. **Day 2 — freeze the schema** with Dan. Open points in `docs/feature_dictionary.md`.
2. **Day 2 — Dan's five hand-collected rows** in this format, replacing the fixture.
3. **Days 3–5 — rubric definitions** from Siegried for the 14 judgement-based features.
4. **Day 5 — joint scoring session**; inter-rater disagreement gets reported, not hidden.
