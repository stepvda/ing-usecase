"""LLM-written recommendations grounded in one analysis run.

The business UI reads a snapshot (`report.json`). This module turns that same
snapshot into a short, ordered list of things ING could change, written by the
pinned model (D6) and every one of them tied back to a measured feature in the
report.

steph 18/09, new module. The web UI is deliberately read-only, so the only
place a model is allowed to opine is here: the report says what the pages look
like, this says what to do about it, and the two never blend - a recommendation
carries the feature and the gap it was argued from, so a reader can reject it.

Guardrails, because a recommendation is where this kind of project goes wrong:
  * The prompt receives ONLY numbers that are already in the report. The model
    may not introduce a figure of its own, and the output is not trusted to.
  * Every recommendation must name the features it is based on; ids are checked
    against the report before the list leaves this module.
  * `selected` is carried through so the UI can pass a subset to site
    generation without this module knowing anything about the site.
  * Trends (`include_trends`) are opt-in and add recommendations on top of the
    analysis ones. They are labelled `basis="trends"` and carry the search
    window they came from. They are context, never evidence - the same line
    trends.py draws - so the prompt may use them for timing and focus only, and
    a trends recommendation is never allowed to cite a page feature as proof.
