# and they are measuring the wrong thing. The constant is named for the first
# case found; the set has since grown to cover rules that misdescribe the page
# for reasons other than the capture.
#
# cta_count: no counting rule proved defensible across the 14 banks. The stored
# HTML is the post-JavaScript DOM (render.py returns page.content()), so the
# cards ARE in the file - ING's pack page holds 144 clickable elements. What
# differs is what counts as one CTA: the keyword list missed real buttons
# ("Demarrer", "devenir client"), and the structural rule that caught them
# counted navigation menus instead (hellobank 79 against roughly 10 real). The
# number would report the markup convention, not the page's intent.
# cta_contrast_ratio: same root cause, one step worse. collection/render.py
# finds the element to measure by walking `a, button` and taking the FIRST label
# containing one of its own keywords, then breaking - so it reports the first
# keyword match in DOM order, typically the navigation, not the primary CTA. Its
# keyword list is also a separate, older copy than collection/scraper.py's. All
# three ING pack pages report exactly 7.01, which is the tell.
# has_animation / animated_asset_count: the rule is `"@keyframes" in html or
# "animation:" in html`, so it reports "this stylesheet declares an animation",
# not "this page moves". Across the compared family exactly one page carries
# real motion - Revolut's, via a <video> element. Every other bank flagged as
# animated has no video and no GIF, only CSS rules that may drive a spinner or a
# cookie-banner fade. Deck claim H3 was tested against this column, so the claim
# rested on a measurement that does not mean what its name says.
# has_comparison_table: the rule is `soup.find("table") is not None`, so it
# reports whether the page uses an HTML <table> element, not whether it compares
# anything. Traditional banks mark their tariff grids up as tables; N26 and
# Revolut build the same plan comparison in CSS and score False - their captured
# text carries the plan names and monthly prices all the same ("standard" 148
# times on N26's page, "metal" 19). The split it produced, 0.57 of traditional
# pages against 0.00 of challenger pages at d = -1.23, is a difference in HTML
