"""Cross-sell score and product co-occurrence matrix.

the "cross-sell score/graph" from the AI Marketing
Intelligence brief, built on `cross_sold_products` (feature_dictionary.yaml,
extracted by the same single structured call as `target_personas`). No new
LLM call here either - the score and matrix below are pure arithmetic over
that one column, same spirit as `ai_score.py`.

SCORE: the brief's own formula, "products offered / products possible", kept
as a literal 0-1 ratio (not rescaled to 0-10 like ai_score.py's axes, since
this already IS a share, not a composite index). Per page: len(cross_sold_
products) / (taxonomy size - 1). The -1 stands for "a page cannot cross-sell
itself", but read it as a flat constant, not as a per-page exclusion: the code
never looks at that page's own product_family, and the cross_sold_products
taxonomy carries 10 values against product_family's 7, so the denominator is 9
for every page. Two consequences worth knowing before quoting a number. The
numerator counts `other` along with the nine real types, so a page naming all
nine plus `other` would score above the nominal 1.0 ceiling. And the never_paired
matrix indexes the full 10-value taxonomy, so rows that are not a product_family
at all (insurance, credit_card, partner_perk) always have a page count of 0 and
land in insufficient_data by construction rather than by measurement. Neither
has bitten on this dataset, and changing the denominator now would move a figure
already quoted, so the behaviour stands and this describes it rather than the
intention. A bank's score is the mean across its pages; None (never a fabricated
0) if the column is absent or entirely empty for that bank.

MATRIX (the "graph"): this repo has no graph-drawing library, and one wasn't
worth adding for 7 nodes - a co-occurrence table already answers the brief's
two questions directly: the largest cells are "products most associated", the
zero cells (see `never_paired`) are "missed opportunities" / products never
offered together.

`never_paired` split into confirmed vs insufficient_data. With
only 1-2 real pages in a product family (mortgage, pension, savings_account
today), a "0" in that row is almost always "we never had the chance to see
it", not "these two products are genuinely never combined" - the same small-N
honesty `analysis.py::ing_vs_peers()` already applies (MIN_PEERS_FOR_SD). A
row family needs at least MIN_PAGES_FOR_CONFIDENT_NEVER pages before its zero
cells are reported as a real finding rather than a data gap.
